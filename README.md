# A-star-search-algorithm-in-python
My very own A* search algorithm made in python with the use of module pygame.

## Before You Execute .py file
Two windows pop up: one asks you whether you want to see the steps of the algoritm. If **YES**, **tick the box** and **press the button "Done"**.

## Controls
  - _**LEFT MOUSE CLICK**_

## Requirements:
  - Python 3.x
  - modules:
    - pygame
    - threading
    - numpy
    - tkinter
    
    
Enjoy.
